# ML-NLP-Interpretability-explainability
Community for reading, prototyping and researching papers that address interpretability and explainability

Community-driven efforts to discuss ML or NLP papers specifically with respect to interpretability, explainability and transparency and foster an inclusive, safe, and open platform that allows it. This repository contains notes and discussions for our monthly paper discussions. You will find notes, questions, and other findings and topics the community found interesting.

## June 29th - Monday - 1st Session - Reading Paper - A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions
### http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions

#### We all read this paper and discussed some of the concepts and importance of interpretability. Shope about SHAP, its history, pros and cons between LIME, DeepLIF and Tree SHAP. Each of us shared lots of business insights and also shared relevant links for others to learn more about interpretability.
