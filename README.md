# ML-NLP-Interpretability-explainability
Community for reading, prototyping and researching papers that address interpretability and explainability

Community-driven efforts to discuss ML or NLP papers specifically with respect to interpretability, explainability and transparency and foster an inclusive, safe, and open platform that allows it. This repository contains notes and discussions for our monthly paper discussions. You will find notes, questions, and other findings and topics the community found interesting.
